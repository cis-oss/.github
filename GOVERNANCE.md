> This document outlines the governance policies for this open-source project. It describes how decisions are made and how the community is expected to operate.

## Project Maintainers

The current maintainers of cis-oss projects are (if not stated otherwise on a project level):

*   [Alix von Schirp](https://github.com/B00tLoad)
*   [Ole](https://github.com/jateute)

Maintainers have the following responsibilities:

*   Guiding the overall direction of the project.
*   Reviewing and merging pull requests.
*   Managing issues and discussions.
*   Publishing releases.
*   Enforcing the code of conduct.
*   Making decisions about the project's roadmap.
*   Nominating new maintainers.

## Decision Making

Decisions are made through a lazy consensus model. This means that proposals are generally accepted unless there are objections.

1.  **Proposals:**  Anyone (including maintainers) can propose a change, feature, or policy by opening a pull request or issue.

2.  **Discussion:**  The proposal will be discussed in the pull request or issue comments.  All community members are encouraged to participate.

3.  **Consensus:** Maintainers will aim to reach a consensus on the proposal. If there are no objections after a reasonable period (usually 5 business days after the first comment by a maintainer), the proposal is considered accepted.

4.  **Voting:** If consensus cannot be reached, maintainers will vote. Since there are two maintainers, a simple majority is required for a decision to pass.
    In the event of a tie, the decision will be deferred for further discussion or, if necessary, the status quo will be maintained.  Maintainers should strive to avoid deadlock and seek compromise.

## Adding and Removing Maintainers

**Becoming a maintainer:**

New maintainers can only be proposed by existing maintainers. A maintainer can nominate a candidate for maintainership. The existing maintainers will then discuss and vote on the proposal in private. A unanimous vote from the existing maintainers is required to add a new
maintainer.

When considering a candidate for maintainership, the following criteria should be taken into account:

*   **Demonstrated Commitment:** The candidate should have a consistent history of contributing to the project, including submitting pull requests, reviewing code, and participating in discussions.
*   **Technical Proficiency:** The candidate should possess a strong understanding of the project's codebase and related technologies.
*   **Community Involvement:** The candidate should be active in the community and demonstrate a commitment to fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment.
*   **Communication Skills:** The candidate should be able to communicate effectively and respectfully with other contributors and users.
*   **Understanding of Project Goals:** The candidate should have a clear understanding of the project's goals and roadmap.

Maintainer nominations will be evaluated without prejudice to employer, demographic background, or any other factor unrelated to their ability to fulfill the responsibilities of a maintainer.

Upon acceptance, new maintainers will be granted the necessary GitHub rights and permissions to perform their duties and will be invited to the internal maintainer Discord server.
Once a candidate has been approved, a pull request to this `GOVERNANCE.md` file will be made, including the new maintainer's GitHub username.

**Removing Maintainers:**

Maintainers can be removed from the project under the following circumstances:

1.  **Voluntary Resignation:** A maintainer may voluntarily resign their position at any time by notifying the other maintainers.  A pull request will then be made to update this `GOVERNANCE.md` file to reflect the change.

2.  **Emeritus Status:** A maintainer who wishes to reduce their involvement but still contribute in a limited capacity can request Emeritus status. This request should be discussed among the maintainers. If approved, the maintainer will be listed as an Emeritus Maintainer in this file.
    Emeritus Maintainers will no longer have the responsibilities of active maintainers (e.g., reviewing pull requests, voting) but may still contribute to discussions and provide guidance.

3.  **Temporary Suspension:** In situations where a maintainer's conduct is under investigation or there are serious concerns about their actions, the other maintainer(s) may vote to temporarily suspend their privileges. This requires a simple majority vote.
    Suspension is intended to be a short-term measure to allow for a fair and thorough investigation. The suspended maintainer will be notified of the suspension and the reasons for it.
    During the suspension, the maintainer will not have the ability to merge pull requests, make releases, or exercise other maintainer privileges.

4.  **Involuntary Removal:** In exceptional circumstances, it may be necessary to remove a maintainer against their will. This requires a two-thirds (2/3) majority vote from the existing maintainers.
    A proposal to remove a maintainer should be made via a private discussion among the maintainers, followed by a formal vote. The reasons for the removal should be documented, though the specifics may be kept private to protect the individual involved.
    *This process should be used sparingly and with careful consideration.*

**Appeals Process:**

A maintainer who has been involuntarily removed has the right to appeal the decision. The appeal must be submitted in writing to the remaining maintainer(s) within 10 business days of the removal notification. The appeal should clearly state the reasons why the maintainer believes the removal was unjustified.
The remaining maintainer(s) will review the appeal and render a final decision within 10 business days. The decision of the remaining maintainer(s) is final.
Temporary suspensions are not subject to appeal.

## Communication Channels

*   **Public Communication:**  We use GitHub Discussions as our main public communication channel for community support, and general discussions.
    Feature requests and Bug reports should be communicated through GitHub Issues.
*   **Maintainer Internal Communication:** Maintainers use a private Discord server for internal discussions, coordination, and sensitive topics.
