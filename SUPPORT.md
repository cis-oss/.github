# Support and Help

## Resources
Need help with something? Check out the following resources:

### Documentation
Most of our projects feature a documentation site. You can find the documentation for each project in the respective repository. It can usually be found at http://cis-oss.github.io/{project-name} and will usually be linked on the repository home as well as the README file.

### Issues
If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue in the respective repository. We will do our best to address it as soon as possible. Please don't open issues for general questions, as these are better suited for the Discussions section.

### Discussions
Many of our projects have a Discussions section where you can ask questions, share ideas, or get help from the community. Check the repository for more information.

### Stack Overflow
If you have a question that is not specific to a particular project, you can ask it on Stack Overflow. Be sure to tag it with the relevant tags for the technologies you're using.

## What NOT to do
Please **do not** do any of the following:

1. Do not reach out to us (CISLabs) on social media or via email for support. We do not monitor these channels for support requests.
2. Do not reach out to contributors or maintainers directly for support. We are all volunteers and may not have the time to respond to individual requests.
3. Do not open duplicate issues or discussions. Before opening a new issue, please check if it has already been reported or discussed. Also don't litter the issue tracker with "me too" comments. If you have something to add, please do so in a comment.

The above guidelines are in place to ensure that we can provide the best support possible to the community.
Public questions and discussions are the best way to get help, as they allow others to benefit from the answers and solutions provided. Thank you for your understanding!
